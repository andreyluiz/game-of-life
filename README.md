# John Conway's Game of Life

In 1970 a young matematician called John Conway created what he named Game of Life. It consists in a two dimensional board filled with cells (like a chess board) that can extend to infinity.

Each cell may be dead (white) or alive (black) an can have 8 neighbors at maximum (top, bottom, left, right and diagonals).

Time in this universe runs gradually by steps. And in each step, the cell can live, reborn or die based on three rules (or laws):

1. If the cell is alive and have 2 or 3 alive neighbors, it lives.
1. If the cell is dead but have exactly 3 neighbors, it reborns.
1. In any other condition the cell dies.
